### Requirements:

1. The app will provide an organization system basesd off of a cateogry system or a folder tree system.
1. The app will provide low-data previews of the assets so users will not have to download full assets for previewing (example: user uploads big 4k video and the app generates a compressed 480p version for previewing).
1. The app can have multiple password protected user accounts.
1. The app will provide functionality to share assets through public links that can be restricted with passwords or expiration windows.

   Stretch goal: permission system for the users to allow and/or restrict access and certain actions to certain users.
